                We met through mutual friends, but we didn't hit it off so well from the beginning. 
                After our first date we didn't see each other for weeks to months. We wrote it off as the past and carried on as usual.
                Until we met again...

                We unexpectedly found each other waiting for different interviews in the same company. We were nervous, but chatting calmed our nerves. 
                Then we realized we could actually make something more...
                so we decided to give our chemistry a shot!

                Before he proposed he had a ring ready for several weeks and kept it on his person to make a fly proposal (that's just how he is). 
                On November 8th, 2017, they both decided to take the day off work to volunteer at a health clinic.
                Time went by like a blink and they finished exhausted and happy. She had a red-eye flight visiting family in Washington, so they went to get a caffine kick.
                Maybe it was the coffee, maybe it was the dreadful red-eye, maybe the fatigue, but these two were clearly madly in love.
                He knew it was the right moment to pop the question, so he pulled out the ring and made the best of the moment...Yes, she was suprised.
